The schema and query .sql files in the data folder allow for the creation of a database and tables
and analysis of the data, respectively. csv files that are part of the database are included in the
data folder.

The schema and query files were made in Postgresql. A png file named "ERD" describes the data in the
database and the relationships between tables. 

The schema creates tables and copies data from csv files to put into the tables. The user's Postgresql/PgAdmin
path to the data files must be copied into the COPY code in order to copy the data into the tables. Or, the 
data can be imported via PgAdmin.
